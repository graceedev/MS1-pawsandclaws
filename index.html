                <p class="team-text">We are proud that our on the ground team is entirely made up of volunteers. 
                    These hard-working, dedicated people come from all walks of life, and are united in their love for animals.
                    Their hours spent volunteering for us means that we can ensure all money donated to us can go towards the animal's welfare.
                    They are the beating heart of all we do! 
                    <br>
                    While caring for so many animals is hard work (we house around 200!), we always make time to have fun and make friends.
                    We have annual team building events and a Christmas party! Volunteering is a great opportunity to learn new skills,
                    such as dog grooming, vetinary care or even just getting fit from all those walkies! 
                    <br>
