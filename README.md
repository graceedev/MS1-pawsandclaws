# Paws and Claws
## About
Paws and Claws is a domestic animal charity in South Wales, created for my msp1 for Code Institute. 
Unfortunately, many domestic animals are relinquished to shelters due to negligence, life changes and ignorance.
This has caused an undoubted strain on shelters who often rely on the general public to donate money or time to run their operations. Paws and Claws is designed to be appealing to the general public and provide them with enough information to decide whether they want to volunteer or donate to the charity.
Due to time or material constraints, many animal charities have out of date, unappealing websites that make it hard to find relevant information due to the sheer quantity of information provided.
While discussing the website design with potential users, it was apparent that it was important to them to know what exactly the charity does (what their aims are), what they have recently been working on, and find information about donating easily. This is why Paws and Claws will keep its design as simple as possible.
Recent research has shown that people are more likely to donate their time or money if the charity in question makes them ‘feel good’ about their decision.  Thus it is important to consider how the website makes the user feel, is it a positive experience for users. The website has room for the charity to expand; there is room to add more campaigns if necessary and additional features can be implemented if necessary, while keeping the most important features the same.

## Designs
### Surface
#### Colour 
The main colour for the website is a mid-toned dusky blue. This was chosen as blue is often associated with sincerity and reliability, which are attractive attributes for a charity. Yellow was picked as a contrast colour for call-to-action buttons and important information. This not only makes this information ‘pop’, but it creates a fun, appealing colour scheme that is easy on the eye. An off-white, blue-toned colour was used for the background to main text, which is in a dark blue colour. This is to reduce eye-strain and make sure the website is accessible to colour blind and dyslexic people.
